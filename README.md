rodent_anat - Anatomical pipeline for rodent MRI based on fsl_anat interface
============================================================================

rodent_anat is an open source image pre-processing pipeline for rodent structural
MRI (i.e., T2-weighted scans). It is modelled on the fsl_anat interface.

What you can do with rodent_anat

The primary purpose of rodent_anat is to provide rodent structural MRI research 
with a standard, flexible, and robust image processing platform, which can 
generalise across scanners and acquisition protocols.
